# MeArm pocket Size Manipulator

MeArm is a 3-DOF robot arm, that is controlled by arduino and connected to matlab using ROS. 
In this project both forward and inverse kinematics were constructed to model the robot motion towards the desired postions.

## Build
 
test

Upload the ino code on the arduino board
download the Matlab Excutable GUI file
You can run this roslaunch file that will excute all the ROS nodes, and use the gui to control the robot
this is a test
